Team I Meeting Minutes:

Meeting 1 Friday, March 29th, 3:00 pm:
All members attended.
We will use the completed A5 assignment as a skeleton for our app.
Johnny added it to the repository and we all pulled to ensure we had access.
We decided to divide the work with each one of us focusing on one major component of the app and the features that needed to be implemented for the first sprint.
Analytics: Timothy, Create a new event: Johnny, Homepage: Andreas, Opening Page: Itel,  Stopwatch/Timer: Eric
We decided that we would all communicate when we’d be pushing and keep local copies and fix all merge conflicts as they come up due to the number of members and how we divided the work. Because we’re working on different parts of the app we should all have merge conflicts in files like strings.xml

Meeting 2 Monday, April 1st, 9:00 pm:
All members attended.
Johnny was the first to push, Itel pulled to see how it would affect what he coded. The only merge conflict was in strings.xml, and was solved easily.
We talked about our goals for the first sprint and whether they were still achievable at this point, and we decided that everything seemed achievable at this point.
We talked about when we would meet up with our mentor Kai, and started to think about availabilities to give him. Update: We’ll meet with Kai on Wednesdays at 4:30 pm during his office hours.

Meeting 3 Wednesday, April 3, 4:30 pm:
All members attended.
We first met with Kai and went over our goals for the sprint and whether they were still achievable, at this point we agreed that we would let him know if anything came up, but we were still going to maintain our current sprint goals.
We showed him what we had done at the moment including the start of create event, the opening, etc.
We met by ourselves afterward and went over when we would meet next time to contribute to the app together in a group and talk about goals. We decided we would meet the next day, Thursday at 8:30 pm to update one another on progress. 
We updated our sprint goals on our GitHub project page.
We finished by talking about our strategy for pushes moving forward as we would start to have a lot more of them. 

Meeting 4 Thursday, April 3, 8:30 pm:
All members attended.
The goals for sprint one for the Opening Activity, Homepage, and Create new event are completed. Everything was pushed and any merge conflicts were resolved. The stopwatch/timer has most of its functionality and should be done by the next time we meet before recording our demo. We will continue to work on transitions from different parts of the apps and sending data over to different activities.
We also decided to talk to Kai about the dynamic visual part of the timer and stopwatch and it constantly updates as the timer and stopwatch countdown. We are waiting for a response.
We updated our sprint goals on our GitHub project page.
We decided to continue working individually on our parts to optimize functionality and visual appeal. We decided that we would meet again on the weekend to go over everything and check if we met our sprint goals, how to record the demo, and practice before recording the actual demo. We decided to solidify a time after we finished working on the different components of the app.

Meeting 7 Sunday, April 3, 3:30 pm:
All members were in attendance.
We finished the app implementation asynchronously and came together to run the app on several different devices, do error checking, and record our demo.
After talking we added more error checking like ensuring the text that the user enters is under a certain character count, locking the app in portrait mode, etc.
We updated the GitHub sprint 1 project page and began talking about what we would need to finish in the second sprint.
We started to wrap up by creating a script for our demo, deciding what app to record it on, and recording it.
Finally, Johnny submitted everything as he recorded the demo on his computer.

Sprint 2 

Team I Meeting Minutes:

Meeting 1 Wednesday, April 8th 4:15 pm:
All members attended.
We met with Kai and went over our goals for sprint 2 and whether they were still achievable, at this point we agreed that we would let him know if anything came up, but we were still going to maintain our current sprint goals.
We didn’t have much to show him as we had just finished presenting sprint 1 the same day.
We met by ourselves afterward and went over when we would meet next time to contribute to the app together in a group and talk about goals. We decided we would meet the next day, Thursday at 9:00 pm to update one another on progress. 
We updated our sprint goals on our GitHub project page.

Meeting 2 Thursday, April 9th, 9:00 pm:
All members attended.
We had some merge problems with resource files but otherwise, everything looked like it was going well.
Timothy implemented Firebase and connected it to the app.
After some discussion, we decided that for usability reasons, users might want to use the app on different devices and if the user has the app on another device the points wouldn’t synchronize, so we’re going to implement a login page and store all user data in firebase and synchronize it to shared preferences constantly from one activity and the other activities can just use the data from shared preferences.
We decided to split up the work for the sprint with Timothy continuing to work on the stats features, Itel on pet features, Andreas on the profile, Johnny on Firebase synchronization, and Eric on the login page.

Meeting 3 Saturday, April 17th, 4:30 pm:
All members attended.
We met to talk about progress and take a break until after the midterm to continue the implementation of our respective features.
We talked about maybe implementing the Google Calendar API into our so we could create tasks/events based on events already in one’s calendar. We decided it might be doable but we would decide after we turned in the second sprint to see how achievable it would be.
We gave each other updates on where we were in our individual tasks and whether anything was unachievable during this sprint.

Meeting 4 Thursday, April 19, 2:30 pm:
All members attended.
We couldn’t meet with Kai the day before, but we have been messaging him through Slack and he told us we would most likely be presenting on Monday and that we should try and finish as much as we can so that we have something to present on Monday. 
We talked about what the professor said in class in terms of grades and the different implementation due dates. As per the professor’s suggestion, we thought we should be able to have a fully functioning app by the presentation date and only do error checking and such after our presentation.
We began discussing what we might do for the final sprint and what we would focus on. We also discussed meeting on Sunday for fine-tuning and presentation practice.

Meeting 5 Sunday, April 22, 3:30 pm:
All members were in attendance.
We had been talking both yesterday and today about any updates we had regarding the tasks we had assigned. We started pushing on Saturday our individual work. As we decided last sprint we decided to wait until the end to push to avoid having as many merge conflicts which we felt worked last time. 
Everything seems to be going well and the synchronization for shared preferences and firebase seems to be working well and is being used throughout the app. We decided to meet again later today in person to go over everything.



Meeting 6 Wednesday, April 24, 4:00 pm:
All members were in attendance.
We checked in with Kai about the progress we had last week and discussed the choice of timer settings about when the user clicks on the item scheduled, should we start the timer immediately. 
Kai also discussed some other technical mechanisms about the creation of events for us to implement for sprint 2.
